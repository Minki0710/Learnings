#Notes about Regex files
/text/ --> Literal text match
/text/i --> adding 'i' ignores case of letters
/text/g --> adding 'g' matches the word text as many times as it is in the data
/te.t/ --> adding wildcard '.' will match with any letter in place of dot eg:tent, text, test
/[a-z0-9]/ --> adding hyphen '-' creates range and matches all numbers and letters in the range
/[^aeiou]/--> adding caret '^' removes text you don't want to match, this example matches all characters that are not a vowel
/^text/--> adding caret '^' outside [] will match if the text is at the beginning
/text$/--> adding dollar '$'  will match if the text is at the end
/\s/ --> adding '\s' matches whitespaces
/\S/ --> adding '\S' matches non-whitespaces

/[A-Za-z0-9_]+/ === /\w+/ --> It will match all letters and numbers
[^0-9] === \D --> matches non-numbers
